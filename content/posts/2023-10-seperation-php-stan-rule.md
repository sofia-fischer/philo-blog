## Seperation of (PHP) Code

### Public stuff 

I would like 

### Daily Relection

Morning Pages: The Idea is to write down your stream of consciousness, thoughts, ideas, dreams, fears. It is meant to 
process and order your thoughts, it helps to review problems and celebrate a win.

- The Pages should not be shown to anyone, do not read them yourself. 
- Three pages are recommend, but if you only want one - write one, if you write five - fine
- Morning Pages are not ordered, they should order you. 
- They don't have to be in the morning (I write mine in the evening). But is should be a habit, and therefore it is 
  ought to be done at the same time every day.

#### Inner Explorer
