oAuth is a hard to get into because of its (necessary) complexity. A basic understanding of the flows and the actors
involved can help to make better decisions and understand the security implications of the choices.

## Who is the User and how trivial is this question?

A Service need to know who the requesting user is, what the user is allowed to do and if that information is still
valid. The most common way to achieve this is by using static credentials (like username and password) - assuming that
if the credentials are known, the requesting user must be the user to which the credentials belong.
Such static credentials often come with a lot of problems [^static_credentials]:

* Anyone with the credentials can impersonate the user
* Static credentials may be brute-forced or leaked
* Humans are humans and will write them down, use them multiple times, or share them with others
* It's hard to revoke credentials without changing them or the system
* Credentials don't include any information about the user or their permissions
* Credentials are often used for a long time because changing them is hard (and humans don't like it)

[^static_credentials]: [Static Credentials and why they are one of the biggest hazards in modern IT](https://schlomo.schapiro.org/2016/05/lifting-curse-of-static-credentials.html)

Instead of trusting that only the two parties know the static credentials, a service should trust a third party to
verify the identity of the user. One very simple implementation including a third party is using the mail provider as
authentication authority. The user logs in with the email and a random string that was sent to the email.

However, this flow is neither very secure nor very user-friendly. The user has to switch between their email client and
the application; and mails offer many attack vectors, with the simplest being that the mail is intercepted used for
authentication before the user can use it.

## Why oAuth and why is it so complicated?

If you log in to a service by authenticating against a different service, you might use oAuth. The process of clicking
on "login using xyz" on a website that is not xyz, entering your credentials for xyz, and then being redirected back is
the oAuth flow.

"But what about OpenID Connect?" OpenID Connect is a layer on top of oAuth that adds an identity layer. In theory, oAuth
can work by only providing an access token with a scope (which can be used as permissions) without any information about
the user. OpenID Connect builds on the oAuth protocol and adds an identity layer.

[^oAuthOpenID]: [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol)

Authentication is a requirement that so many services have in common, and therefore a range of attacks on user identity
have been developed.
The need for an user-friendly authentication that also considers even unknown attack vectors is why oAuth was defined -
it is a protocol that that defines how a service may authenticate a user in diverse use cases.
It contains flows that might appear complicated at first, but are necessary to cover all attack vectors and use cases.

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
It is okay to not understand every protocol detail - a web developer doesn't need to know all about oAuth flows to
authenticate a user if they just use an existing library and authentication service.
For most languages and frameworks, there are libraries that implement oAuth and make it easy to use.

## oAuth Authentication Flows

The flows are defined in the RFC 6749[^oAuth], while I found the best overview at curity.io [^curity] and Auth0 [^auth0].

[^oAuth]: [RFC 6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)
[^curity]: [The OAuth 2.0 by Curity](https://curity.io/resources/learn/oauth-overview/)
[^auth0]: [The OAuth 2.0 by Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/which-oauth-2-0-flow-should-i-use)

### Terminology

**Actors:**

* **Resource Owner** - The human that can authenticate
* **Resource Server** - The server that holds the resources, for basic authentication this might be only the user
  identifier
* **Client** - The service that wants to know who the user is
* **Authorization Server** - The server that authenticates the user and issues tokens

As precondition, the Client must register themselves at the Authorization Server to get their own `client_id` to
identify themselves towards this Authorization Server.

Each request should contain the `grant_type` to specify the flow that is used.

**Tokens:**

* **Access Token** - credentials used to access protected resources. The access token provides an abstraction layer,
  replacing different authorization constructs (e.g., username and password) with a single token understood by the
  resource server.
* **Refresh Token** - credentials used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or
  expires. The Access Token should be short-lived to minimize the damage if it ever got stolen or invalid. If the human
  decides to revoke the access, the Access token may remain valid, but the Refresh token will not work anymore.

{{< alert "circle-info" >}}
Json Web Tokens (JWT) are a common format for tokens. The RFC which defines oAuth does not specify the token format, but
JWT is very common, because it can be easily signed/validated and can contain all necessary information.
{{</alert >}}

### Browser Flow - A Service wants to know who the user is

1. The Client initiates the flow by directing the human to the Authorization Server. The Client includes its
   `client_id`, `scope`, `state`, `code_challenge` and `redirect_uri`.

`scope`: Additional resources of the human. The Client may request certain scopes (e.g. access to the users photos),
the Authorization Server may ignore them based on their policy or the humans instructions (e.g. the human may have
disabled the sharing of their photos during the consent step).

`state`: An Client generated string to maintain state between the request and callback (like a authentication-attempt-id
for the Client) to prevent cross-site request forgery. The Authorization Server includes this value when redirecting the
user-agent back to the client.

`code_challenge`: A hash of a random string, the `code_verifier` that the Client will use to authenticate itself later.

`redirect_uri`: The URI to which the human will be redirected after the Authorization Server has processed the request
and the human has granted access.

2. The Authentication Server checks if the `redirect_uri` is registered for the `client_id` to prevent Redirect URI
   manipulation (that would authenticate the human for one Client and then redirect the human and access information to
   an evil side). Then the Authentication Server authenticates the resource owner and requests grating.

3. The Authorization Server redirects the Human back to the Client to the `redirect_uri`. The redirection URI includes
   an authorization `code` and the `state` provided by the Client earlier.

`code`: A code with which the Client can request an access token from the Authorization Server. The Authorization Server
does not directly add the access code to the redirected uri to make sure that the access token is not visible in the
Humans side history and could then be misused.

4. The Client check if the given `state` matches the stored state (so this oAuth attempt is the same that was started on
   this earlier).

5. The Client requests an access token from the Authorization Server by providing the `code`,
   `redirect_uri`, and the original `code to authenticate itself.

6. The Authorization Server validates the authorization `code`, hashes the given `code_verifier` to check if it matches
   the previous `code_challange` to ensure that the service who requests the access token is actually the service that
   started the process, and ensures that the `redirect_uri` matches the URI used to redirect the Client in step 3 to
   ensure that the intended uri is still the same.
   Finally, the Authorization Server responds back with an access token and, optionally, a refresh token.

### Client Credentials Flow - A Service wants to authenticate against another service without a user present

This flow is used when the Client wants to authenticate itself against another service without an involved Human.
This does not authenticate the Client as a specific user, but as a service; therefore, the Client does not get access to
any human resources.

The benefit of this flow is that the Client can authenticate itself (e.g. against other microservices) in an unified
way, with the possibility to change permissions on the fly, while minimizing the number of calls using static
credentials.

1. The client authenticates with the authorization server and requests an access token from the token endpoint with its
   `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `scope`.

   `client_id`, `client_secret`: The credentials of the Client to authenticate itself against the Authorization

2. The authorization server authenticates the client, and if valid, issues an access token.

## oAuth Token Flows

### Refresh - A Service has a token and wants a new token without the user present

To keep the access token short-lived and the user experience smooth, the Client can request a new access token with the
refresh token. To prevent malicious usage, the `refresh_token` in the response is not the same as the one that was sent
and the Client has to update their refresh token.

### Token Exchange Flow - A Service has a token, but wants one from a different Authentication Authority

If a Client has an access token from one Authorization Server, it may need a token from the same Authorization Server
with other privileges to conform the least-privileges principle. Token exchange also allows you to cross security
domains by exchanging a token from one trust domain to a token of a
different one.

One case for this can start from enabling a user experience in which the user can use a third party service with a
trusted Authentication Authority to enabling a service to act on behalf of a user in a different security domain.

A different use case is authentication of short-lived processes, for example CI/CD pipelines that need to authenticate
against a different service to upload artifacts or read secrets. GitHub or GitLab may allow to run pipelines on
container-based runners in their infrastructure. A human may initiate a pipline, which uses the users access token to
retrieve an access token that can be used to authenticate against the artifact repository [^federated_pipeline].

* **Subject token** - The token that the Client has
* **Actor token** - Optional Deligation token if the Client acts on behalf of a human or another service
* **Requested token** - The token that the Authorization Server returns

### Other flows

**Device Flow**: A Service wants to authenticate a User on a device with limited input capabilities (e.g. a TV)

**Revoke Flow**: A Service wants to invalidate a refresh token before it expires

**Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant**: The Client asks the Human for their credentials, which requires a high
trust in the Client.

**Implicit Grant**: The Client gets the access token directly from the Authorization Server, which misses one security
level.

## Conclusion

oAuth is a complex protocol that is necessary to cover all attack vectors and use cases, but enables a secure and
convenient way of authentication and authorisation. The complexity of the protocol is hidden behind libraries, but a
developer who is aware of the flows can make better decisions and understand the security implications of their choices.

Because the complexity is hidden, developers should not hesitate to use oAuth for their services, especially in
Microservice environments the benefits of a unified authentication and authorization are huge (not only on technical or
security side, but also unified processes help people to focus on individual problems).

As always, I am happy to hear your thoughts and or improvements on my explanations.

Happy Coding :)
