Is Imposter Syndrome an individual problem or a team culture issue? How can team dynamics influence
feelings of inadequacy among developers?
{{< /lead >}}

## From Individual Problem to Team Culture Issue

> The term [Imposter Syndrom] pathologizes the insecurities regarding ones capabilities to a defect of the individual,
> instead of a reaction to systemic issues
> like lack of recognition, absence of promotion opportunities, or discrimination in the workplace.

(Sophia Fritz, Toxische Weiblichkeit, my translation)

[^toxischeWeiblichkeit]: Toxische Weiblichkeit: Wie Frauen sich und anderen schaden (German Edition) by Sophia Fritz

Reading this changed my perspective on Imposter Syndrome, moved it from something that everyone has to deal
with on their own, to something that is influenced by the team culture and environment.
Changing team culture will not solve systemic issues, nor will it prevent any feeling of insecurity.
The point is that it is not just a personal task to build confidence, but a shared team responsibility to create an
environment where every team member feels recognised, authentic, and competent.

## Looking into Scientific Literature

Following the Hierarchy of Evidence, I looked for Meta-Studies and Systematic Reviews on the topic of Imposter
Syndrome. I would recommend "Workplace Imposter Thoughts, Imposter Feelings, and Impostorism"[^paper]; other papers
focused only on the pathology of Imposter Syndrome in individuals [^pathology], or did not as dive deep into the
comparison of results of multiple studies[^academic_imposters].

[^paper]: Workplace Impostor Thoughts, Impostor Feelings, and Impostorism: An Integrative, Multidisciplinary Review of
Research on the Impostor Phenomenon by Basima Tewfik, Jeremy Yip, Sean Martin.

### History, Definition, and Symptoms

"Imposter Syndrome" is a very modern term, that got more popular since around 2015.

{{< alert "comment" >}}
I am kinda sad that the connection my mind made to the 2018 Game "Among Us" is completely wrong.
{{< /alert >}}

Throughout the years the term is defined by the cognitive belief that others overestimate one’s competence at work.
But it also includes feeling of intellectual incompetence, concerns about being exposed as a fraud, or feeling
unauthentic.
There are multiple hypotheses about the cause of Imposter Syndrome[^academic_imposters]:

* Perfectionism and Fear of Failure: Perfectionism, especially socially defined perfectionism makes individuals highly
  sensitive to perceived failures. This can cause a black-and-white thinking of anything that is not a perfect success
  must be a failure.
* Social Comparison Theory: People define their own worth based on how they compare to others, Imposter feelings are a
  result of comparing one with high-achieving peers - even if the comparison is biased like comparing new joiners with
  long term employees.
* Cognitive Dissonance Theory: If people have the belief that they are not competent, any success will create a
  dissonance that is resolved by downplaying the success or attributing it to external factors.

Imposter Syndrome is linked to lowered job satisfaction, higher stress levels, even depression and burnout. Although,
some studies found the imposter phenomenon was a critical driver of work productivity of management consultants or
working hours of students.[^paper]

{{< alert "comment" >}}
While the paper is multiple times cited for showing the benefits of Imposter feelings on productivity, I want to point
out that the upsides mainly benefit the organization - while many of the negative impacts are on the expense of the
individual.
{{< /alert >}}

### Trait or State?

There are studies that link Imposter Syndrome to situational factors - starting a new role that differs from
experiences, working after career breaks, or as a result of competitions.

Still, Imposter Syndrome is often described as a personality trait, focusing on correlations with low self-esteem,
neuroticism, and perfectionism. Multiple studies found higher prevalence among woman and other marginalized groups.
Not all studies find such correlations though, especially when comparing people within the same role (the probed roles
where leadership roles or surgeons); while students and post-graduates showed the highest gender difference[^paper].

{{< alert "comment" >}}
The connection of Imposter Syndrome to marginalized groups is tricky. Some symptoms of Imposter Syndrome like lack of
belonging or doubt in own skills are often central obstacles marginalized groups face in their careers.

Imposter feelings are also associated with lower career striving, (perceived) higher stress, underestimation of own
skills, and lower job satisfaction - which could lead to less representation of marginalized groups in senior roles,
leaving a bias in studies focusing on such roles. The origin of this can both be because people with imposter syndrome
might not apply for such roles or people who do not advance in their careers are more prone to develop imposter
feelings.

Linking Imposter Syndrome to marginalized groups can easily backfire to the question if imposter syndrome
might be a symptom (or even a driver?) of career inequalities in marginalized groups.
{{< /alert >}}

To conclude, the beliefs that feed the Imposter Syndrome can come from individuals themselves or the situations they are
in. In both cases, it is not a trait that someone has all their life or never - but a state that can change over time
and with context, and for which some people might be more vulnerable.

## Team Culture Patterns and Anti-Patterns to reduce Imposter Feelings

Regardless of the question of Trait vs State, in a team context one can allways assume that team culture is easier to
change than personality traits of individuals.

### A feeling of belonging

**Celebrate Learning new Things in a Safe Environment** Social rules that are stated explicitly and are valued by the
whole team are a basis for creating a safe environment. A good example are the Social Rules of the Recurse
Center [^socialRules]

* "No feigning surprise" - don't act surprised when someone does not know something
* "No well actuallys" - don't correct someone if the correction does not benefit the conversation
* "No Backseat Driving" - don't give unsolicited advice on how to solve a problem you are not working on
* "No Subtle -isms" - no sexism, racism, ableism, ageism, or any other -ism that can make people feel excluded

[^socialRules]: (Social Rules of the Recurse Center)[https://www.recurse.com/social-rules]

**Anticipate new Joiners** You are here because we want you to be here and believe in you!
A feeling that is easier for teams to spread that have the autonomy to select new members, but still
possible in more hierarchical structures. Something I mostly observed for very famous new joiners, but a habit that I
would wish for every new joiner: In the first days showing excitement about the new team member joining, show interested
in past projects, skills, and experiences. Maybe the manager already provided some information, a blog, a past project,
or open source contributions. This helps to create a feeling of being wanted and welcomed for the skills and
experiences.

**Show a shared Vision** Belonging to a team means working on a shared goal. A critical part of that is also to be able
to connect the current tasks to the big picture. There will be "high impact" tasks that are directly contributing, and
they should be shared in the team. On the other hand, the "low impact" tasks require a context to connect them to the
vision.

**Love Power sharing - Hate Power Trips** In this context "Power" does not mean "authority", Power means having a
privilege another person is lacking - not having Imposter feelings, knowing the codebase well, not being part of a
marginalized group...
A team member that calls out the achievements of others, shows vulnerability, shares knowledge altruistically, is open
for cooperation / pairing shares power[^39C3].

[^39C3]: On the 39C3 the phrase "Love Power sharing - Hate Power Trips" was used on multiple occasions to describe how
to create inclusive environments in and outside the hacker community.

**Have a diverse Team and diverse Leaders**. Missing representation can lead to feelings of not belonging. If there is
no one that resembles your background / culture / gender in the hierarchy above you, it is harder to believe that you
can also reach such a position. Diverse teams also help to create an environment where different perspectives are
valued, and different communication and working styles are accepted.[^representation]

### Make it easy to Achieve

**Enable Achievements outside of Code** Software Development is more than coding - Shadowing Users, Writing
documentation, improving processes, code reviews, sharing knowledge ... Such tasks should be recognized as valuable
contributions to the team vision, should be mentioned, should be celebrated.

**Let Ticket Refinements happen in the Team** A refinement can be a safe space to ask questions, clarify the business
need behind the ticket, and discuss possible implementations. This can easily change the perspective from a ticket that
sounds "too complex or to hard for me" to a ticket for which "I know the solution and the pitfalls to avoid". It is
easier to pick up such a refined ticket, easier to start working without big code investigation, it instantly provides a
feeling of competence for the task.

**There should be easy tickets** An easy ticket should include all necessary information, enable one immediately to
start coding, and be achievable in less than a day. This is important for new joiners, as distraction from highly
complex tasks, or on dull afternoons.
Never will all tickets be easy - but there should always be some easy tickets available to pick from.

**Tickets should have a definition of done.** Having to go over and over a task because the result is unclear or
requires multiple feedback loops is a common source of frustration and self-doubt. Why didn't I got it right the first
time? Why don't I understand what is expected from me? A clear definition of done helps to avoid such situations and
also helps to estimate ones resources required to finish the task.

### Have a Culture of Recognition - not Competition

**Asking for Help is normalized** Asking for pairing should not just be done by the team members who are looking for
guidance - but also by team members who want to share knowledge. It does not require a "I need some help here", it can
be "Is someone up for discussions on the technical approach?" or "Would be great to share knowledge about this domain".
Any habit that is only perceived from juniors or new joiners will create a hesitation to pursue such habit - this can be
asking for help, seeking validation, or admitting mistakes. [^culture]

**Post only Team Metrics - never individual Metrics** Any metric that compares the performance of individuals will be
exploited by team members who are driven by competition and will foster a feeling of inadequacy in those who are not.
No metric will adequately reflect productivity. It cannot capture learning curves, mentoring efforts, or
the contributions in discussions, documentations, mentoring, code reviews, or team culture.
AFrom looking up "the number of PRs per month for each team member" to weekly postings of "who closed the most
tickets" - any of those metrics should be handed with care.

**Everyone should be part of Celebration** Celebrating team successes helps to create a feeling of belonging and
achievement - but only if everyone is included. Meaning, on that celebration slide every team member should find
at least one point they connect to their contributions. This does not mean that everyone has to be named (I personally
would even discourage that), but that everyone can find their part in the success story.

**Mentoring** Mentors or Buddies can provide constant guidance and affirmation. They can help to navigate the new
environment, provide technical guidance, and be a safe space to discuss insecurities. [^academic_imposters] They can
ask coaching questions to help overcome self-doubt and imposter feelings.

## Personal Strategies

There are also personal strategies to deal with Imposter feelings. While the papers showed the success of Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy, that is a very personal decision to pursue, and nothing I have any qualification to comment on.

I want to provide some questions and reflections that can help to better understand ones own feelings

* **Observe** When do I have feelings of Incompetence? Are there specific situations that trigger these feelings? When
  am I not feeling this way? What do I feel when achieving something, and what if I fail?
* **Question Believes**  Was there ever a person stating that I lack a skill or trait, or is it my interpretation of the
  situation? If the latter, which situations trigger this thought? What beliefs do I have about my own competence? If I
  allow Myself to be curious about these beliefs, where do they come from?
* **Investigate Alternatives** How do I define Success and Competence? Do I like my definition? Are there other team
  members struggling with similar issues? Can I talk to them about it?
* **What can help?** What does help I with these feelings? How can I ground Myself in moments of insecurity, and remind
  Myself of my skills and achievements? Can I do a training that helps me to get more confident in the skill I feel
  lacking?

## Conclusion

Imposter Syndrome is not a personality trait. I worked at companies where I did felt valuable and competent after a few
days, others in which I was struggling with feelings of inadequacy for months.
I worked in teams where a belonging and communication was a high priority, and other where it wasn't.
I had managers who emphasized my growth and opportunities, and others who only cared about results and numbers of
whatever metric they valued. Imposter Syndrome was and is a companion in my career, but it's strength and impact is
highly influenced by the team culture I am in.

I am striving to create a culture in my team in which Imposter Feelings are acknowledged and quickly replaced by
feelings of belonging and value.

Happy ~~Coding~~ Communicating :)
