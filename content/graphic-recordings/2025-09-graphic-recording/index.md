Graphic Recording is a visual practice that involves capturing and synthesizing information in real-time during
meetings, workshops, or presentations. It combines elements of drawing, writing, and design to create large-scale visual
representations of the content being discussed.

I want to learn Graphic Recording to enhance my ability to communicate complex ideas and concepts in a more engaging
way. It combines my interests in art and communication. To learn this skill I started with the book "Graphic Recording -
das 1 x 1 der Live-Visualisierung" [^book] by Martina Grigoleit, and various online resources and booklets.

While I learned about graphic recording when visiting the DevOps Days in 2023, I also got inspired by the blog posts from
Julia Evans [^JuliaEvans].
